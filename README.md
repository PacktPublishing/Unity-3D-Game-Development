# Lost Exodus (A vertical slice)

This project is a vertical slice designed for the book "Unity 3D Game Development". 
It's intended purpose is to be a visual aid and training mentor throughout the book.
If it's your first time here, we recommend finding your way to the builds folder and play the game.
After you play it, you're welcome to get into the project itself and see what we had done to build this slice.

A note to remember - game development is difficult. There are bugs in this game that we didn't catch or left intentionally
to work through within the community as lessons learned. If you aren't part of the community, please join our discord link:
