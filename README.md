# Lost Exodus (A vertical slice)

This project is a vertical slice designed for the book "Unity 3D Game Development". 
It's intended purpose is to be a visual aid and training mentor throughout the book.
If it's your first time here, we recommend finding your way to the builds folder and play the game.
After you play it, you're welcome to get into the project itself and see what we had done to build this slice.

A note to remember - game development is difficult. There are bugs in this game that we didn't catch or left intentionally
to work through within the community as lessons learned. If you aren't part of the community, please join our discord link:

## Known Issues
The team had many ideas to make this vertical slice as good as possible, but life had happened throughout this project
and certain things needed to be cut. We will continue to update this project to get it to a strong state while learning with the community.

### Art Issues
Overall art style isn't fully polished. All of the environment work has a lot of work to be up to par for a AAA title.

The team wants to work through multiple things that we had envisioned:
- Architectural work in the final area to tell more of the narrative
- A bridge transition to the final area as a dynamic piece
- The visual effects across the entire project is lack luster
- Hair and clothing dynamics
- Custom HDRI for each environment area
- More time on day to night cycle transitioning into the final puzle region
### Gameplay
**Camera Controls** - The camera controller movement feels like moving through oil instead of a smooth experience.
We need to take time to put into this more complete.

**Character controller** - The movement feels floaty and not grounded into the environment. The team woudl've loved to 
take the time to put together a clean IK charater setup to step up on rocks that were in teh way as well
as dealing with environment itself. Maybe add a jump!
